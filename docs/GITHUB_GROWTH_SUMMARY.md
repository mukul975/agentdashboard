**Launch Plan Contents:**

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (Feb 11-24, 2026)**
- Week 1: Foundation (GitHub optimization, demo creation)
- Week 2: Content creation (launch posts, social media, supporter lineup)

**Phase 2: Launch Week (Feb 25 - Mar 3, 2026)**
- **Launch Day (Tuesday, Feb 25)**: Hour-by-hour schedule
  - 12:01 AM PST: Product Hunt
  - 6:00 AM PST: Show HN on Hacker News
  - 7:00 AM-10:00 AM: Reddit posts (r/programming, r/selfhosted, r/MachineLearning)
  - All day: <1 hour response time on all platforms
- **Engagement Day**: Dev.to article, community participation
- **Community Day**: LinkedIn, newsletter outreach
- **Media Day**: Tech newsletter emails, Indie Hackers
- **Weekend**: Build-in-public content
- **Analysis Day**: Metrics review, supporter thanks

**Phase 3: Post-Launch Momentum (Mar 4-10, 2026)**
- Daily: <4 hour GitHub issue response
- Ship first improvement based on feedback
- "Week 1 learnings" article
- Potential AMA or Twitter Space

**Platform-Specific Content (All Drafted):**
1. **Show HN**: 3 title options + detailed 200-word introductory comment
2. **Reddit**: Custom templates for 15+ subreddits
3. **Product Hunt**: Complete description + maker comment
4. **X/Twitter**: 7-day content calendar with 20+ tweet examples

**Target Communities Identified:**
- Subreddits: r/programming, r/selfhosted, r/MachineLearning, r/opensource, r/coolgithubprojects

**Contingency Plans:**
- HN post flagged → resubmit with adjusted title
- Product Hunt flop → focus on Reddit + X/Twitter
- Reddit posts removed → use Show & Tell threads
- Server overwhelm → scale with Vercel Pro
- Major bugs → hotfix within 2 hours

**Research Basis:**
- Average HN front page = 121 stars in 24 hours, 289 in 7 days
- Tuesday-Thursday optimal launch timing
- "I built" framing > marketing speak
- Visual content = 2x engagement
- Multi-platform coordination creates viral loop

**Expected Impact:**
